### Hi 👋

I'm Liu Wenyuan. In case you need to know, my pronouns are `he/him`.

- ~🔭~ I’m currently working on making random stuff
- ~🌱~ I’m currently learning about being lazy
- 💬 [Ask me](../../issues) anything, at least if I'm even going to reply
- All of the above are jokes. Sorry for my lack of sense of humor.
- 📫 Contact me...
  - ...through email:
    - liuwenyuanbackup@gmail.com
    - dobby233liu@cock.li (less used)
  - ...through Discord: Dobby233Liu#1069 (`614002959663235082`).
    DMing me would probably work (I have no idea); if you want to friend please provide a reason, and please also except your friend request to be rejected, especially if I don't know you.
