### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Liu Wenyuan. Also known by some other aliases which I forgot. I don't think I'm a great programmer in any way but well... I write code.

As of now, my contribution graph in 2025 is terribly barren, mostly because
- I'm not really concentrated on any specific projects in the coding realm these days (don't have a lot of motivation)
- For code projects I've been working on, even if they're source-available, I likely didn't bother to publicly publish the code here

As for why I have this many repos... let's say I was young and naive

I have random repos pinned below for your enjoyment or dissastifaction vv

#### ðŸ“« Contact me...
- ...through email: liuwenyuanbackup@gmail.com
- ...through Discord: [`@dobby233liu` (`614002959663235082`)](https://discord.com/users/614002959663235082). \
  DMing me might work if we share servers (which I'm not confident about).
  If you want to friend me, please provide a good reason, and expect your friend request to be rejected (especially if I don't know you).
  *How do I put this... whether I accept your FR or not, that is \*my\* decision, and don't expect it.*
- The [Issues section](https://github.com/Dobby233Liu/Dobby233Liu/issues) is certainly a way to make contact, although I most likely would miss things.
