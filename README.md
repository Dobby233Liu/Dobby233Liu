### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Liu Wenyuan. Also known as some other aliases which I forgot.

As of now my contribution graph in 2025 is terribly barren, mostly because
- I'm not really concentrated on any specific projects these days (don't have a lot of motivation)
- For projects I have been working on, even if they're source-available, I likely didn't bother to publicly publish the code here

As for why I have this many projects... well I was young and native

#### ðŸ“« Contact me...
- ...through email: liuwenyuanbackup@gmail.com
- ...through Discord: [`@dobby233liu` (`614002959663235082`)](https://discord.com/users/614002959663235082).

  DMing me might work (I'm not confident).
  If you want to friend me, please provide a good reason, and expect your friend request to be rejected (especially if I don't know you).
  *How do I put this... whether I accept your FR or not, that is \*my\* decision, and don't expect it.*
